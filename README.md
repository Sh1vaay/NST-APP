# Style Transfer

This repository contains a one-day project plan on "AI for Artistic Style Transfer" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create an AI model that can apply the artistic style of one image (the style image) to another image (the content image) using CNNs. This technique is known as Neural Style Transfer.

## Required Knowledge

- Understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Familiarity with Python programming language
- Basic knowledge of TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Lite
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
